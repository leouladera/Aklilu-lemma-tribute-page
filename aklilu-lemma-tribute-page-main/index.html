            Foundation to serve as an umbrella for all endod-related work.
            Following collaboration with Lemma, the University of Toledo, USA,

            control the zebra mussels which have recently invaded American lakes
            and caused extensive damage to water supplies. This has opened a
            major new hope for marketing and exporting endod as a cash crop.
