      <h2>Lionel Messi</h2>
      <h3>professional soccer player</h3>
      <p>
        Lionel Messi is a football player from Argentina who plays for FC
        Barcelona. He has won the Ballon D'Or, the annual award given to the
        best player in the world, 7 times, 2022 FIFA World Cup winner and an
        Olympic gold medal winner in 2008. He was born in 1987 in Rosario,
        Argentina's third-biggest city. He showed an enormous aptitude for
        football and was in the youth teams for Newell's Old Boys, his local
        team. Faced with mounting medical expenses to treat a growth hormone
        condition, Messi's family accepted an offer to move the 13-year-old
        prodigy to FC Barcelona, who would pay for his treatment. Messi has gone
        on to become one of the most decorated players in football history and
        has broken countless records for his club and his country.
